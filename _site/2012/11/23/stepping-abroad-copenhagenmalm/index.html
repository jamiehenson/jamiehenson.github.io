				<p>I’ve had the city break bug since I nipped to Amsterdam a couple of months ago, and since grand expeditions to South-East Asia or the Amazon aren’t really on the cards for a weekend on a student’s budget – a weekend in Scandinavia seemed like a great choice to continue on from Holland. Realistically though, my choice of destination was largely influenced by easyJet’s pricing scheme. Gotta love that airline.</p>

<p>It was surreal just upping sticks on the Friday night, and being back for lectures on the Monday morning – slotting straight back into the routine. You collapse on the sofa when you get back and just think, “shit, I’ve just been to Denmark”.</p>

<p>Both Denmark and Sweden made a different impression on me to Amsterdam. Everything was super clean, and efficient – and we were as much interested in the clever gadgetry woven into the fabric of the city as the famous Danish design and architecture. Amsterdam had an underlying sense of dirty humour, Scandinavia generally seems a lot more traditional and sensible.</p>

<p>One thing that was really strange and unexpected was that, walking around Copenhagen, I was reminded of when I went to America. It sounds absurd: the temperature neared 0<strong>°</strong>, the culture was blatantly European, and people tended to walk or cycle from A to B.</p>

<p>But the roads were wide enough to accommodate 6 lanes, there were 7-Elevens _everywhere  _(stocking proper Mountain Dew, an addiction of mine since Michigan), and there was an underlying feel of Americanisation. Take our hostel. It was 18 stories high. US-esque tower block on the outside, but inside we had a room straight out of an Ikea catalogue (I know that’s in fact Swedish and rather generalist, but you get the idea).</p>

<p><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030350.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030350_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030350" title="P1030350" /></a> <a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030382.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030382_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030382" title="P1030382" /></a></p>

<p>Saturday morning was the crossing of the border to Malmö (I discovered it was pronounced more like Mal-mer, not Mal-moh as my English tourist logic wrongly believed). We were only there for a few hours, but we managed to have a good walk around, seeing several landmarks including Malmö castle, which we all mistook for a warehouse, or an abandoned factory. It wasn’t a dazzling structure. Safe though, I bet.</p>

<p> <a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030435.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030435_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030435" title="P1030435" /></a> <a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030457.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030457_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030457" title="P1030457" /></a></p>

<p>Some highlights however were tasting some Swedish kanelbulle (a cinnamon roll, I raided every cafe in sight for them after sampling my first one), and witnessing the extraordinarily intriguing street performer pictured above.</p>

<p>Back in Copenhagen, it was time for an all-you-can-eat pizza extravaganza, before heading onwards to a theme park (always a good decision). The Danes hit Christmas hard, I can say that. It was mid-November, and Tivoli Gardens was the most concentrated example of pure Christmas I think I’ve ever seen. It makes the Bristol effort look like the decorations bin at Poundland. There was a scale model of the Moscow Kremlin, a pyramid of bears, a laser light show across the water, and a few quirky rides which cost a billion pounds each to ride on. A couple of us went on one, which we lovingly referred to as the ARM Experience (it had a big swinging arm). It was worth the billion pounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030462.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030462_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030462" title="P1030462" /></a> <a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030483.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030483_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030483" title="P1030483" /></a> <a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030489.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1030489_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030489" title="P1030489" /></a></p>

<p>By this point, we were running out of kroner. I’m not sure if the exchange rate favours the Danes, or whether it’s just an expensive place to be in. A bit of both, perhaps. But still, £5.50 for the cheapest pint… come on, now.</p>

<p>We spent the last day doing as much walking as possible to pack in the city sights. We saw the changing of the guard at Amalienborg Palace, I went up the Rundetårn for a cracking view of the city, saw the Little Mermaid statue (standard tourist choice, but it was the only thing I knew about the city prior to coming – it’s actually really tiny), and visited the Danish History Museum, amongst other things. Before long, it was time to head off back down South and West to the UK.</p>

<p>It was a great trip, truly, and for ~£100 all-in for the cost of going, sleeping and coming back – it was very affordable (conveniently omitting the fact that it becomes significantly less affordable should you want to spend any money there!). It would be interesting to see the place in the Summer, for a whole different perspective to the Christmassy and crisp November.</p>

<p>Where next though, who knows!</p>
