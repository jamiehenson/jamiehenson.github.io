				<p>My most recent purchase was a Baja Telecaster, my final decision after months of research and flitting between hollow-bodied and solid-bodied guitars. I would strongly recommend it to anybody, and bonded with it very quickly after I first picked it up in a shop back home in Stoke. I still love it!</p>

<p>While the classic 1952-based specification has many advantages, there was one primary feature I grew not to like, and that was the loud buzz when plugged in, but not playing. I’m not talking the standard single-coil hum that is customary of Fender instruments, it was far more severe. I’m talking some sort of grounding problem, since touching any metallic part of the guitar would kill the buzz – I was earthing it. Fine when playing seriously or using a noise-gate, but when chilling in my room noodling away, it was annoying as hell.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Scouring the internet for help (my first port of call in many a situation), I found that installing copper shielding was an almost sure-fire way of killing that buzz, at least on a Telecaster. So I set to it.</p>

<p>The main thing you need is adhesive copper tape. It may sound like a tricky and expensive thing to get hold of but it really isn’t. A trick is to visit garden centres or home stores. They sell it to line plant pots, to deter slugs from crawling up and having a chomp on the plants (they get a small electric shock from the copper). Alternatively, I got some on eBay for under £4, which was perfect! (<a href="http://bit.ly/TsZyqS" title="http://bit.ly/TsZyqS">bit.ly/TsZyqS</a>) Try to make sure that the adhesive of the tape is conductive.</p>

<p>Aside from that you need a screwdriver to disassemble/reassemble your guitar, a generous length of wire, and a multimeter if possible.</p>

<p>The first step is to remove the strings and loosen all the components (but don’t detach them, that isn’t necessary). The bridge plate will need to come off though.</p>

<p><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1020977.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1020977_thumb.jpg" alt="P1020977" title="P1020977" /></a></p>

<p>Then, when you can get inside the body with little obstruction from the components, get the tape, and line the cavities with it. This may seem like I’m jumping steps here, but it’s really quite a simple and repetitive process. I got my flatmate to help me, to get the job done more quickly! You peel off the back of the tape, and lay it down inside the neck, bridge and control cavities, making sure there’s a little overhang spilling onto the top of the guitar – it’ll make the connection job more thorough! The good thing about foil is that it can mould smoothly into any shape - you’ll have a complete coat in no time. And the whole procedure is completely reversible.

<p>&lt;/table&gt;
Many guides differ in how thorough you need to be. From my experience it’s important to make sure these criteria are fulfilled:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Full coverage of each cavity, i.e. no gaps.</li>
  <li>A little overhang on the body (but not enough to be visible after the bits are put back on).</li>
  <li>Overlapping strips is key. It’s an easy way to get full and guaranteed coverage (but don’t go mad).</li>
  <li>Most importantly, electrical continuity. This is what the multimeter is for. Insulate a cavity, then make sure you can detect a reading all round it. The aim of the game is to basically make the guitar into a massive capacitor, so you need to ensure the whole thing can conduct.
The other guides however claim that you need to solder the strips together, and/or remove the components (pickups etc…) entirely. The first is only required if the adhesive of the tape is not conductive (the tape I linked above is), and the second is only required if you don’t like fiddly work, are planning to replace your pickups anyway, or have too much time on your hands. My procedure took literally half an hour, with no soldering.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have your cavities fully insulated with copper foil, you need to connect them. Take two short lengths of insulated wire (just enough to go between the neck and control cavities, and the bridge and control cavities respectively), strip the ends and use them to connect the neck and bridge cavities with the control plate cavity, via the guitar’s internal tunnels.</p>

<p>You don’t need to solder the wires down, you can instead use copper tape to fix them to the copper-lined floor of the cavity on each end – which is sufficient. Then, make sure that you have enough of an overhang on your control panel to create a copper link between the cavity and the panel itself. This completes the circuit, as the current then goes via the metal components though the output jack and into your grounded amp.</p>

<p>When all is connected, it’s time to reassemble your guitar. Note the more noticeable overhang on the neck cavity, this is because the pickguard will cover it, and so there is less need to be stingy with the copper:</p>

<p><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1020982.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1020982_thumb.jpg" alt="P1020982" title="P1020982" /></a></p>

<p>As well as lining the body cavities with copper, it’s also a good idea to coat the underside of your pickguard with tape. It’s super easy.</p>

<p>That’s it! I plugged it in, went on a ‘metal’ setting on my amp (high gain etc…) and it no longer screamed and hummed. On a ‘clean’ sound, the guitar was silent when not playing – the shielding really does work wonders. And all in under an hour and for less than four pounds.</p>

<p>If you have a single-coil guitar with a similar problem I wish you luck!</p>
