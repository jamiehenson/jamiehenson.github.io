				<p>Earlier this year, I decided that I should travel more. I have an income now (of sorts), and Uni has given me the confidence to throw some clothes into a bag and scan Easyjet for imminent cheapies. I’ve been to a handful of places this year for longer stints (approx. a week), but I’m talking quick city breaks – where you can pile onto a plane Friday evening and be back Sunday night in time for lectures on Monday morning. University allows that flexibility. I get the feeling that when I start full time employment, I’ll no longer have as much leeway.</p>

<p>First was to go to Amsterdam, this past weekend. Coincidentally, it was also my 21st birthday on the Saturday, so what better way to make something of it! My birthday lies in a crap point of the year, especially these days. It sits in the limbo period between people being at home, and people being at University, so it’s hard to get something with large numbers arranged. Me and two others went, it’s an easy number to manage.</p>

<p>The total cost (flights, accommodation and other initial costs) was roughly £180 for 3 nights, Friday to Monday. By the end we’d probably spent around £300 each, not a bad amount.</p>

<p><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030051.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030051_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030051" title="P1030051" /></a><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030050.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030050_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030050" title="P1030050" /></a></p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was the support for the English language. A good number of signs and notices were in English, with no Dutch equivalent. Every single person I spoke to spoke English flawlessly, and was happy to talk to you. Ashamedly, I don’t speak a word of Dutch, so this was certainly helpful, but it was just interesting to see the locals speaking English to their own compatriots as well - on the trams, in cafes, on the street. Unlike the French perhaps, who I’ve found can get a little catty when they discover you can’t speak their lingo.</p>

<p>The support for English tended to peak in what could be considered the “tourist” areas. When I went to Rotterdam and Den Haag on the Sunday, everyone still spoke it, but since these cities were more industrial and less commercial it was less relevant in the environment.</p>

<p><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030002.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030002_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030002" title="P1030002" /></a>Amsterdam has a wide range of attractions, as anyone who has heard of what the city’s famous for will know. Naturally, we walked along the canals during the day, through the Red Light District at night, detected the distinctive smells wafting from the coffeeshops scattered around the city. Around De Wallen (where the RLD is), I expected to feel uneasy. Everything was either rammed into your face with potent neon lighting, or subtly lit with dark red lamps, with every other window containing a girl wearing next to nothing, posing. Sure, you’d get the guys in the long coats going to the windows to enquire about a “purchase”, but there was never any sign of crime, or bad behaviour. None. There were married couples walking around. Elderly folk. It was strange. I feel more uneasy out at night in my home town.</p>

<p>My impression as a tourist who does his own thing (i.e. with no tour guides or whatever) was that in general around Holland, there seems to be a system of tolerance and respect. There is prostitution and mild drug-taking in plain view, but it’s heavily policed, and regulated. Therefore, for those interested, there’s no need to make a crime out of it. When I took trains around the country, my ticket was not checked once, but I was told that the penalty for being caught freeloading would have been severe. I respected that. This just doesn’t happen in the UK. Everything is buried under policy and a lack of common sense, and you’re charged through the ear for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030078.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1030078_thumb.jpg" alt="P1030078" title="P1030078" /></a>The nicest way to get around Amsterdam I found was a water-bike. A pedalo, basically. On the day of my birthday, we were peddling at a leisurely pace around the canals with full sun in the sky. It was lovely, and I got some great snaps out of it. It cost us 10 euros each for an hour and a half – well worth it. You can find them along the west side of the Central quarter, from outside the Rijksmuseum upwards.</p>

<p>Bicycles were everywhere. At all times of the day. Everywhere had a bike lane, and you better believe that they get right of way! It took some getting used to, having to look both ways for bikes, then stepping forward to do the same for cars. I got an angry bell my way several times.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn’t have the time to go and visit the city’s many museums. On city breaks I prefer to walk around and see things – it’s also the cheaper option. And that certainly applied here – Amsterdam is an expensive place! One place, it was 6 euros for a beer. £4.80. And not even a pint. It’s in a pint glass, but you get 3/4 drink and 1/4 froth. Needless to say, the lads soon regretted their offer to buy the rounds on my birthday night. Other examples included 4 euros for a waffle and 3 for a cone of chips!</p>

<p>It’s expected though, as Amsterdam is both lovely and the country’s capital. It’s a tourist trap as well as a hub. As I mentioned previously, Rotterdam and Den Haag had less to see. Rotterdam has the world’s 3rd largest port and great modern architecture (because it was levelled in the war), and Den Haag has the parliament and royal buildings (and the International Court), but not a great deal else. I’m probably wrong, of course, but that was my first impression. As for Amsterdam, I felt like I only scratched the surface of it over the 3/4 days I was there. I would certainly go back.</p>

<p>Next up: Copenhagen in November!</p>
