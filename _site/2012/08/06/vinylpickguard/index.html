				<p>I go through phases of what pickguards I want on my guitars - I own a couple of different colours for each one I have, and swap them depending on the mood. Trouble is, is that they usually cost around a tenner a time, and for what they are (essentially a piece of thin plastic), that’s rather pricey. I then remembered that my flatmate had dozens of old vinyl records lying around, and made the connection that they would do a fairly decent job of being a scratchplate, whilst also looking a little different!</p>

<p>Interested in making your own? To start off with, I recommend you have these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vinyl record (duh)</li>
  <li>The old pickguard</li>
  <li>Heavy duty scissors and/or Stanley knife</li>
  <li>Source of constant heat (hob, oven etc…)</li>
  <li>File</li>
  <li>Drill
Pretty simple really. Although, it’s worth noting that the guitar you have, and the way it is built, has an impact. For example, on a Telecaster like mine, the detachment and installation of the pickguard really could not be easier - due to the simplistic design. You unscrew it, and pull it off, job done. However, with a Stratocaster-based guitar, all the front-facing body parts are fixated to the pickguard, so you have to manually detach the pickups, the volume/tone knobs, everything. Replacing the pickguard would generally require a re-string, since re-attaching the pickups to the plate is pretty challenging with the space restrictions imposed by having the strings still on. More importantly, the pickguard you make for a Strat would have to be notably more precise than a Tele, since a Tele guard has one hole - a Strat’s has several fiddly ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Undeterred? Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first step is to remove your old pickguard, and lay it on top of the vinyl so that the vinyl covers all of it. Obviously it’s best if you have a guitar with a pickguard that’s smaller than 12” diameter.<a href="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1020924.jpg"><img src="http://jh47.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1020924-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="P1020924" /></a>
&lt;/br&gt;2.  Take the knife and score a border around the old pickguard, leaving a trace on the vinyl to cut. Point of no return, it sure won’t sound like it did any more! Make sure the trace is nice and visible.
&lt;/br&gt;3.  Vinyl is very brittle, and therefore horrible to cut. Don’t try and cut it with the scissors straight away, since the vinyl will most likely shatter or develop a crack straight down your new pickguard. You need to heat it up to make it more malleable. I can think of two ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The probably more intelligent way to do this is to fill a baking tray with boiling water from a kettle, and lay the vinyl to soak in it for a short while. When it becomes sufficiently bendy, take it out. While hot, cut the vinyl with the scissors around the trace you scored earlier. When it gets cold, put back in the water, and repeat until done. Cutting out the pickup holes is the most challenging part.</li>
  <li>Another way is the way I did it, which is a little more unsafe! Wear an oven mit, put on some mouth and nose protection (I used a towel), and hold the vinyl over a gas hob until the exposed part of the vinyl starts to go bendy. Then cut as before. The problem is, is that the room gets toxic very quickly with harmful chemicals, so make sure you have the window open and an extractor fan on, if possible. You could also use the oven.&lt;/br&gt;4.  You should have a cut out shape of vinyl that vaguely resembles your original pickguard, by now. If the heat has warped the vinyl so it is no longer flat, put it in the oven for a short while between two sheet of greaseproof paper, and when sufficiently bendy, take it out and immediately flatten it with a hard, flat surface like a tray.
&lt;/br&gt;5.  Now it would be wise to see if it fits your guitar. Provisionally lay it on top, and if it doesn’t fit, file down the excess until it does. If you’ve cut too far, then it’s too late, which is why it’s generally better to leave more on than take too much off. Filing is more effective when the vinyl is cold, but don’t be too rough with it, it may still crack.
&lt;/br&gt;6.  Once your pickguard is sufficiently filed to shape, the last step is to make the drill holes so it can be fixed to the guitar. The way I would do it, is to position your drill above the existing hole, and lift it up slightly so that you can slot the guard underneath - then make your hole. Drill gently: again, you don’t want to crack the plastic.</li>
