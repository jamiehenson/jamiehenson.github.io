				<p>A small while ago (roughly a month actually, to think of it), I wrote a post called “<a href="http://jh47.com/2012/12/making-str-entry-one/" title="Making STR: entry one">Making STR: entry one</a>” about my experiences up to that point with developing a semi-professional game, with the “entry one” implying that I would write a follow-up - so here we go.</p>

<p>STR is the current working title for our work-in-progress game. It’s a very modern facelift of the side-scrolling shooter with fast-paced, competitive multiplayer gameplay. Or, at least, that’s what it says on my metaphorical drawing board.</p>

<p>Up to now I’ve had mixed feelings about the project: invigorated by rapid prototypical progress and the liberating enjoyment of making a game completely of our creation for marks, but simultaneously disheartened by the niggling thought of what the game <em>could</em> have been right now - had the team been firing on all cylinders.</p>

<p>You see, I mentioned the importance of project management in the previous article. It truly is important, critical even - to the project’s success. The project manager’s strategies have been tight, adaptive and agile - I have no complaints there. But what hits me is this: we have a prototype that was created entirely by two members of the team (myself being one of them), and a separate primary component not yet integrated into the build, developed by a third member. That leaves three members largely unaccounted for.</p>

<p>This was the culmination of the Autumn term/Winter break. In the first (crisis) meeting of this year, tasks were assigned, apologies were distributed and promises were made. But the fact of the matter is that half of the time is over, and some members of the team sat idly by while the rest of us were forced to put in a very disproportionate amount of the existing work. People have different schedules, I am fully aware, but to instill that kind of pressure on those with a similar educational/extracurricular load is insulting, to be blunt.</p>

<p>I don’t wish to turn this into a rant, because that’s not my point - at all. My intention is certainly not to be personal. Overall, I am very pleased with how the game is shaping up. It’s very solid, looks good, and a framework is developing upon which we can start to expand a prototype into an actual title. I just feel a small sense of disappointment, when I consider what more could have been in by now. But focusing upon such thoughts is a futile and counter-productive venture.</p>

<p>It’s about where to go from here, what directions to take, what elements to prioritise. This whole experience is character building, as well as educational, and I feel stronger for it. Truthfully, I believe that it’s going to turn out well, that communication will strengthen and that the team will gel together as a six for the final half of the development window. I at least hope so. But whatever happens - there’s a lot of work still to be done.</p>
